functionnalities.

## Follow link

Using `xwwp-follow-link` to choose a link on the current web
page. It also highlight the candidates on the web page.

It currently supports `completing-read`, `ido`, `ivy` and `helm` completion
backend. I'm willing to add support for other completion backend, open an issue
with your backend of choice and I'll have a look at what can be done. Or better,
fork and create a pull request, most of the needed code is already there, it
just needs to be hooked.

## DWIM style `M-x xwwp`

DWIM style command adapted from `eww`, smarter than the original `xwidget-webkit-browse-url`.
Automatically prefixes and expands the url, and use `xwwp-search-prefix` to search for it
if input doesn't look like an URL or a domain name.

If called with a prefix ARG, create a new Webkit session instead of reusing
the default Webkit session.

## Browse url in other window

The `xwidget-webkit-browse-url` just update the current xwidget-webkit buffer
but does not bring it to the front (at least on MacOS), which is what you would
expect. The `xwwp-browse-url-other-window` method will also bring it to the
front using `swith-to-buffer-other-window`.

### How to install

Clone the repo locally and
```
(use-package xwwp-follow-link
  :load-path "~/.emacs.d/xwwp-follow-link"
  :custom
  (xwwp-follow-link-completion-system 'ivy)
  :bind (:map xwidget-webkit-mode-map
              ("v" . xwwp-follow-link)))
```

Or via Melpa `M-x package-install xwwp`,
and setup for your completion backend via variable `xwwp-follow-link-completion-system`

## Development

The goal of this package is to enhance the `xwidget-webkit` browser. If you have
any code or feature suggestion that you think should make it into this package,
please open an issue or better, create a pull request!
